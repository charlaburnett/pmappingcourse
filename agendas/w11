          <p>
            This week will be a introduction to our module. We'll get closer to our peers, 
            you'll get to know more about your instructor. We'll start by talking about mapping and cartography.
            Before we can get into reintepreting culture <em>through</em> mapping, we must first talk about the culture <em>of</em> mapping.

                  What makes GIS software so practical is its ability to allow users to create points, 
                  lines, boundaries, referred to as polygons, visual overlay, and raster data. For example,
                   a map of a city could be designed for users to create and store placement preferences as points, 
                   road data can be stored as lines, and boundaries can be stored as polygons, while aerial photos or 
                   scans can be uploaded right into the map as raster images. These various types of data can be 
                   analyzed using an array of simple or complex methods depending on the users’ needs. 
                   Weighted survey data can be added to any number of polygons allowing researchers to create 
                   ranked spatial plans that fuse together various values and preferences. Some can be expressed 
                   in relatively small lists of alternatives and ranked using multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) 
                   using voting, consensus, or soft operations research methods, while others may have so many alternatives, 
                   multi-objective mathematical optimization is needed (Keisler et al., 2014). 
                </p>

                  Participatory Geographic Information Systems (PGIS) is a type of decision support tool that combines Participatory 
                  Learning and Action (PLA) methods with GIS. The term “participatory GIS” or “PGIS” emerged from the use of participatory 
                  approaches with GIS used in rural areas of developing countries (Rambaldi et al., 2006). The applied field of PGIS focuses 
                  on the broader topic of approaches, methods, and processes. PGIS practitioners generally define stakeholders as those 
                  who will be affected by, can bring knowledge to, or possess the power to influence a decision problem (Sieber, 2003).
                   Mapping software allows participants to trace relationships between groups, values, and objectives in a way that goes 
                   beyond the limits of human cognition.
