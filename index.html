        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Participatory mapping is a human practice that spans thousands of years. 
          From oral storytelling, to the first hand drawn maps, participatory processes 
          and methods have always been used in cartography, and yet, the term “participatory mapping” 
          did not become popular until the 1990s. Participatory mapping is used in a broad range of planning 
          and decision-making initiatives.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For many practitioners, participatory mapping can be used to broaden access to spatial 
        data and technology for socially and economically marginalized groups to facilitate decision-making. 
        Activists use participatory mapping to protect indigenous and experiential knowledge and advocate 
        for local knowledge to reshape policy and foster normative behavioral change around land use concepts.  
      </p>
      <p>
        From conservation and natural resource management, rural or urban planning, and social and environmental 
        activism and advocacy, participatory mapping is an important tool to understand the production of spatial 
        knowledge. This class will focus on exploring three case studies of participatory mapping to understand how 
        GIS and cartography can be used as a tool for collecting, managing, and analyzing elements of culture and society.  
      </p>
       <p>In the third portion of IDFA 470,
          <em>The Communication Module "Mapping and PPGIS"</em>, explores new ways of gathering and sharing narrative data 
          on user preferences, with an approach to decision making called participatory geographic information systems (PGIS). 
          This section discusses the procedures used and results of the pilot simulation in addition to presenting an evaluation 
          survey with the goal of measuring specific aspects of the PGIS process. Content analysis of individual responses demonstrates 
          that stakeholders were fairly critical of the model’s validity, relevance, and bias. Differing perspectives reveal the need for 
          greater transparency along with a more iterative pre-planning process that engages participants in the co-production of knowledge 
          and action from beginning to end.  
        </p>
        <p>
          This course will be interested in addressing questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            How have maps been used in the past? What impacts do maps have on society? Who usually tells the story in cartography? How subjective are maps and does it matter?  
          </li>
          <li>
            What types of data/information do maps provide its users? Who decides what data/information is represented on a map? What is participatory mapping? 
          </li>
          <li>
            How can maps be used to tell our ancestors stories? Why does it matter if we preserve this stories in cartography? How is map making different from other mediums?
          </li>
          <li>
           Why is so much of our understanding of our respective cultures tied to geo-physicality? Why do boundaries matter? Who benefits from these boundaries? 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Over the course of the next four weeks, we will be iterating on your story to a map story board.

        <h4>Syllabus</h4>
        <p>
          The class objectives include an exploration of story through examining place in black history, culture and heritage.  The class will be interdisciplinary and begin with introductions by all instructors on September 30.  The class structure is in three parts and includes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <strong><li>Storytelling and Creative Writing (September 13 - October 4, 2021)</li></strong>
          Arola by Zakes Mda for students to write a single-effect character-driven short story with flat and round characters that have adequate motivation and justification underlying their actions, and whose conflict develops in a narrative arc to its climax. This means that this class is not interested in pieces that are sustained only by voice or in open-structure stories. Our focus is on the traditional narrative structure.
          <strong><li>Network Cultures using Digimyths with Kevin Cadena (October 11- November 1, 2021)</li></strong>
          Dynamic, Interactive, Interconnectivity, archival sense of being seen digital tools that include.  This ongoing research class will culminate each year in multi-dimensional presentations.  
          <strong><li>Mapping and PPGIS with Charla Burnett  (November 8 - 29, 2021) </li></strong>
          Looking at ways that storytelling can exist in participatory mapping can be used to broaden access to spatial data and technology for socially and economically marginalized groups to facilitate decision-making.
        </ol>

        <h4>Concept Objectives and Timeline</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Explore our spatial understanding of African worlds through the arts, network cultures, and storytelling</li>
          <li>Encourage a curiosity and passion for research, writing and performance with a digital application component to discover new ways of looking at the world</li>
          <li>Enlighten the Towson community into appreciating black history and achievements in the family of humanity.</li>
        </ul>
